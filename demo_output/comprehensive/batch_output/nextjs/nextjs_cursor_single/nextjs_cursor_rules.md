# Cursor Rules
You are an expert in Next.js, React, TypeScript, and full-stack development.

## Key Principles

- Follow the framework's established patterns and conventions
- Use framework-specific features and abstractions appropriately
- Maintain consistency with official documentation examples
- Implement proper HTTP status codes and error responses
- Follow RESTful principles for API design
- Include comprehensive request/response validation
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Follow security best practices

## Code Style and Structure

- Follow these documented patterns: module imports, async operations, component patterns

## Best Practices

- Implement security considerations
- Consider performance implications
- Avoid documented anti-patterns
- Follow documented best practices

## Technology-Specific Guidelines

### Javascript Guidelines

- Use modern ES6+ syntax and features
- Prefer const and let over var
- Use arrow functions for simple expressions
- Implement proper TypeScript types and interfaces

### React Guidelines

- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper state management (useState, useReducer)
- Use React.memo for performance optimization
- Follow component composition patterns


## Error Handling and Validation

- Use try-catch blocks for error handling
- Implement proper error boundaries in React applications
- Use async/await with proper error handling
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Log errors appropriately for debugging

## Performance Considerations

- Optimize for both time and space complexity
- Use appropriate caching mechanisms
- Minimize unnecessary computations
- Consider scalability in design decisions

## ðŸš¨ Critical Instructions

**NEVER:**
- Ignore error handling or edge cases
- Use deprecated APIs or methods
- Hardcode sensitive information
- Skip input validation and sanitization

**ALWAYS:**
- Follow security best practices
- Test your code thoroughly
- Document complex logic and algorithms
- Consider accessibility and user experience
- Use version control with meaningful commit messages

## Documentation Insights

- Key concepts covered: Access, Validate, Deleting, How, Auth, Further, More, Reading, Capture, Transfer
- Source documentation: https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/authentication
- Refer to the original documentation for detailed examples
- Follow the established patterns shown in the documentation
- Keep up with the latest updates and best practices
- Apply cursor rules best practices for optimal development experience
