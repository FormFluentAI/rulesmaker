# Cursor Rules
You are an expert in nextjs development with deep knowledge of best practices, design patterns, and maintainable code architecture.

## Key Principles

- Use App Router for new projects (not Pages Router)
- Implement proper data fetching patterns (Server Components)
- Optimize for Core Web Vitals
- Use server and client components appropriately
- Follow the framework's established patterns and conventions
- Use framework-specific features and abstractions appropriately
- Maintain consistency with official documentation examples
- Implement proper HTTP status codes and error responses
- Follow RESTful principles for API design
- Include comprehensive request/response validation
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Follow security best practices

## Code Style and Structure

- Use App Router for new projects (not Pages Router)
- Implement proper data fetching patterns (Server Components)
- Optimize for Core Web Vitals
- Use server and client components appropriately
- Follow these documented patterns: module imports, async operations, component patterns

## Best Practices

- Use App Router for new projects (not Pages Router)
- Implement proper data fetching patterns (Server Components)
- Optimize for Core Web Vitals
- Use server and client components appropriately
- Consider performance implications
- Implement security considerations

## Technology-Specific Guidelines

### Nextjs Guidelines

- Use App Router for new projects (not Pages Router)
- Implement proper data fetching patterns (Server Components)
- Optimize for Core Web Vitals
- Use server and client components appropriately

### React Guidelines

- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper state management (useState, useReducer)
- Use React.memo for performance optimization
- Follow component composition patterns


## Error Handling and Validation

- Follow Next.js file-based routing conventions
- Use proper caching strategies
- Implement proper error boundaries

## Performance Considerations

- Use React.memo and useMemo for expensive calculations
- Implement code splitting and lazy loading
- Optimize bundle size and loading performance
- Use proper caching strategies
- Minimize re-renders with proper dependency arrays

## ðŸš¨ Critical Instructions

**NEVER:**
- Ignore error handling or edge cases
- Use deprecated APIs or methods
- Hardcode sensitive information
- Skip input validation and sanitization

**ALWAYS:**
- Follow security best practices
- Test your code thoroughly
- Document complex logic and algorithms
- Consider accessibility and user experience
- Use version control with meaningful commit messages
- Follow Next.js file-based routing conventions
- Use proper caching strategies
- Implement proper error boundaries

## Documentation Insights

- Key concepts covered: Company, Resources, Social, Products
- Source documentation: https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/full-stack/nextjs
- Refer to the original documentation for detailed examples
- Follow the established patterns shown in the documentation
- Keep up with the latest updates and best practices
- Apply cursor rules best practices for optimal development experience
